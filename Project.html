<p>With one of the highest-ranking Police Forces in the world. Why Can't the Metropolitan get London under control? Why does London have a seemingly unthrottled increase in crime rates. And what could be a potential cause? If there is only one?
</p><p>I will be investigating whether crime stems from the poor presence and quality of the Police Forces? Or could it be down to the social conditions of the populations committing them.</p>
<br>
<h3>This is a map of Europe explores the Quality and Quantity of Police forces. Depicting the number of officers each country has per 100,000 residents. Accompanied with data on the Law-and-Order Index.</h3>

<p>The Choropleth Map was produced through an array of datasets and sources all merged and cleaned. The Original base TopoJSON map file was sourced through githubusercontent.com/deldersveld. Meanwhile the Police officer density data was manually scrapped from Wikipedia and formatted with python before it was merged with the Law-and-order dataset to be finally applied to the map.</p>
<br>

    <p>The Law-and-Order Index data came with so many challenges as it had to be PDF Scrapped from an Unstructured Table format. Which required the tabula package from google colab which used inputted coordinates and row/column identifiers to extract data. Since the data was all combined into a large group, split among multiple pages and in different coordinate positions per page. I had to run this process multiple times with iloc() over multiple concatenations to extract all the data to match the 48 countries used in the Choropleth Map. But finally, after Identifying, Extracting, and separating them into 6 tables I was finally able to re-concatenate them once again into a single stacked table with just two columns as an exportable csv file format.
    </p><br>
   <p> HTML Scrappers were essential in collecting data off webpages with tables by allowing me to extract and manipulate the data by filtering it into a wide or long form based on the requirements of the visualisation.</p>
    <br>
        <p>The use of API’s were extremely effective in exploring causality in this question. Since for my regression graphs it allowed me to loop batch download many similar CPI datasets that capture different “baskets of goods” by excluding certain elements. Which could be easily implemented into Vega and tested for their significance in crime rates. Making it a lot more efficient and replicable in finding the most suitable CPI index dataset.

    <p class="bodyText"><span style="color: rgb(49, 6, 40); font-weight: 700;font-size:25px;">Conclusion</p>
    
    <p>To conclude my research task, I have found Violence and Antisocial Behaviour are London’s most prevalent offences which explains the city’s recent climb to the top of the homicide rankings. I tested if this could be down to the UK having one of the lowest police officer densities In Europe. But this factor had no regressive effects in increasing total offences in London. Hence I began to look at more civilian factors that may be increasing the London Crime Rates. </p>
    <br>
    
        <p>There was a very high correlation (R^2=0.71) between Violent Crime offences and a positive percentage change of the CPI (sudden increase in cost of living) . Meaning residents are committing more violent crimes as the cost of living suddenly increases. Which also comes hand in hand with the results from Chart 5 stating more deprived boroughs in London (Lower Deprivation Rank) are found to be committing a staggeringly increased number of crimes than those higher on the index by around 50%.


        </p>
        
      
        <br>
            <p>Overall, the data shows how the issues around London’s Crime rates seem to stem from the social conditions across the boroughs who are committing a lot more crime. Since those who are struggling with the costs of living are found being easily coerced into gang cultures, especially the younger population looking to help support their families. With evidence that the social conditions of London Boroughs and the city itself are continuing to influence the crime rates. Further investigation is paramount to determine the most significant factors keeping London on the top of the homicide rankings year in year out.
